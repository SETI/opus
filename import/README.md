I HAZ NO IDEA

ok trying...

this things should run on the server, after OPUS1 is deployed ideally.. or against a test db.

(ie dump the new table before deploy and copy to this)

Observations_copy

I think:

this things reads forms table in opus1 and
generates models in opus2

and some big sql script creates the actual tables

and actually these two scripts are the same
long ass python script

think it's called: build_obs.py
