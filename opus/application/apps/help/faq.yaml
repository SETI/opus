        Q: >
            What is OPUS?
        A: >
            OPUS (Outer Planets Unified Search) is a web-based search tool that
            allows researchers and members of the public to find and download
            data from NASA missions to the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn,
            Uranus, Neptune, and various bodies beyond such as Pluto and
            MU69/Ultima Thule). It also includes observations taken of those
            planets from the Hubble Space Telescope. OPUS is a product of
            the <a href="https://pds-rings.seti.org/" target="_blank">Ring-Moon
            Systems Node</a> of NASA's <a href="https://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/"
            target="_blank">Planetary Data System (PDS)</a>. In addition to
            the web interface, OPUS supports an API so that third-party
            software can perform searches and retrieve results.

            instruments are available, see <b>About</b> under the
            <b>Help</b> menu. For more information about which particular
            datasets are available in OPUS, see <B>Datasets</b> under
            the <b>Help</b> menu. For more information about the third-party
            API, see <b>API Guide</b> under the <b>Help</b> menu.

        Q: >
            Where are all the pretty pictures?
        A: >
            While we at the Ring-Moon Systems Node like to think that
            <em>all</em> scientific data is beautiful, we understand that you
            might be interested in more traditional images. You can follow
            these steps to retrieve some great ones:


            1) OPUS contains a variety of data types, but you'll want to
            restrict your search to images. You can do this by clicking on
            <b>Observation Type</b> under <b>General Constraints</b> on the
            left side of the <b>Search</b> tab. Then select the <b>Image</b>
            checkbox.

            2) If you are looking for images of a particular planet or moon,
            you can select it in the <b>Intended Target Name</b> search box.
            First click on the planet you are interested in and then you will
            be able to select checkboxes next to the particular bodies
            available. If you skip this step, you will simply get all images.
            Note that this won't give you <em>every</em> image containing the
            body you've selected, but it's a good start.

            3) At this point you can click on the <b>Browse Results</b>
            tab and simply scroll through the thumbnails of the
            (hundreds of thousands of) available images. If you click on a
            thumbnail, you will see a larger image and have the ability to
            navigate using the right and left arrow keys or by clicking on the
            pointing fingers.

            4) If you are really interested in only a single planet or moon,
            expand the <b>Surface Geometry Constraints</b> menu on the left
            and click on <b>Surface Geometry Target Name</b>. Then select
            the body in the search box that appears. This will show you
            every image that contains that body from a subset of the missions
            and instruments that are supported. You will also now have the
            ability to narrow your search by using the search terms in the
            <b><em>Body</em> Surface Geometry Constraints</b> menu. For example,
            you might want to experiment with <b>Body Center Distance</b> or
            <b>Body Center Resolution</b> to restrict your search to close-up
            images.
Using Search:

        Q: >
            How do I search for images that were taken using a particular color
            filter?
        A: >
            There are two methods to search for images that were taken using a
            particular color filter.

            <h4>Method 1</h4>
            This method relies on knowledge of the filters used by a particular
            imaging instrument (currently Cassini ISS, Galileo SSI, Voyager ISS,
            New Horizons LORRI, and the Hubble instruments). You must first
            select the instrument you are interested
            in (<em>e.g.</em> <b>Cassini ISS</b>) by using the <b>Instrument
            Name</b> search box. When you do this, a search menu with a name
            like <b>Cassini ISS Constraints</b> will become available. Under
            this menu there will be a search field called <b>Filter</b> or
            <b>Filter Name</b>. Selecting this field will allow you to select
            one or more filters to restrict your search.


            <h4>Method 2</h4>
            One of the benefits of OPUS is the ability to search across missions
            and instruments using common search fields. For all observations
            where it makes sense, OPUS provides wavelength information under
            the <b>Wavelength Constraints</b> menu. The <b>Wavelength</b>
            search field allows you to restrict your search based on the
            wavelengths avaible in the respective instrument, instrument mode,
            and filter combinations. For example, for an imaging instrument
            the wavelength range is based on the filter bandpass. For a
            spectroscopic instrument, the wavelength range is based on the
            limits of the spectrum collected. This field can thus be used to
            select all observations that include a particular wavelength range,
            and you can use this to restrict your search to observations of
            a specific color. For example, you might look for "red"
            observations by searching for a wavelength range of 600-700 nm.


            Please see the FAQ titled "What do Any, All, and Only Mean?"
            to understand how you can further control your search.

        Q: >
            How do I search for a series of observations that were designed to
            be a movie?
        A: >
            A "movie" is a series of observations that was taken in rapid
            succession while an instrument was pointing at approximately
            the same point in space or while tracking a particular body
            or feature. Movies were most commonly taken by Cassini. In many,
            but not all, cases, movies were marked by the Cassini team with
            an <b>Observation Name</b> that contains "MOV" or "MOVIE". To search
            for these, select the Cassini mission or a particular Cassini
            instrument and then select the <b>Observation Name</b> search field
            under <b>Cassini Mission Constraints</b>. Enter "MOV" in the
            search box using the <b>contains</b> search type. In the special
            case of movies of Saturn's F ring, you can use "FMOV" instead.

            A future version of OPUS will automatically detect observation
            series that appear to be movies or mosaics and provide a specific
            means to search for them.

        Q: >
            How do I search for observations that contain two particular bodies
            in the same observation?
        A: >
            OPUS does not support this particular search directly, but there are
            three ways that you can accomplish this goal with a little extra
            work. Note that methods 1 and 2 only work for instruments that
            support surface geometry (currently Cassini ISS, UVIS, and VIMS,
            New Horizons LORRI, and Voyager ISS).


            <h4>Method 1:</h4>
            A) Restrict the search to whatever mission, instrument, time period,
            volume, etc. that you are interested in.

            B) Under <b>Surface Geometry Constraints</b> select the
            <b>Surface Geometry Target Name</b> search field. Select the first
            body in the <b>Surface Geometry Target Name</b> search box.

            C) Using entries under <b>[Body] Surface Geometry Constraints</b>,
            restrict your search using lighting geometry, distance, resolution,
            etc.

            D) Select the <b>Browse Results</b> tab and then click on
            <b>Download CSV</b> to retrieve a CSV containing information about
            each observation of the first body.

            E) Go back to the <b>Search</b> tab and select a different body
            under <b>Surface Geometry Target Name</b>. Restrict this search as
            desired.

            F) Select the <b>Browse Results</b> tab and then click on
            <b>Download CSV</b> to retrieve a CSV containing information about
            each observation of the second body.

            G) Use your favorite comparison tool or text editor to look at the
            two CSV files to see which observations they have in common.


            <h4>Method 2:</h4>
            A) Restrict the search to whatever mission, instrument, time period,
            volume, etc. that you are interested in.

            B) Under <b>Surface Geometry Constraints</b> select the
            <b>Surface Geometry Target Name</b> search field. Select the first
            body in the <b>Surface Geometry Target Name</b> search box.

            C) Using entries under <b>[Body] Surface Geometry Constraints</b>,
            restrict your search using lighting geometry, distance, resolution,
            etc.

            D) Select the <b>Browse Results</b> tab and visually scan through
            the thumbnails looking for images with two or more bodies in them.

            E) When you find such an image, click on the
            <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-xs"></i> icon or select
            <b>View Detail</b> from the observation's menu. Scroll down the
            Detail page to see which bodies are present in the observation.


            <h4>Method 3:</h4>
            Note: This method is only applicable to Cassini observations. In
            many cases, the Cassini team marked "mutual event" observations
            using the Cassini <b>Observation Name</b>.

            A) Restrict the search to the Cassini mission or a particular
            Cassini instrument. You can also restrict your search by time
            period, volume, etc. at this time.

            B) Select the <b>Observation Name</b> search field
            under <b>Cassini Mission Constraints</b>. Enter "MUTUALEVE" in the
            search box using the <b>contains</b> search type.

        Q: >
            What do Any, All, and Only mean?
        A: >
            Some types of metadata vary for each pixel in an observation.
            For example, an image covers a particular swath of sky, and each
            pixel corresponds to a unique right ascension and declination.
            An observation of a planetary ring will cover a radial range and a
            longitude range. An observation of a body will have a range of
            incidence, emission, and phase angles. To make these
            ranges easy to search, OPUS summaries them for each observation
            by recording the <em>minimum</em> and <em>maximum</em> for any
            pixel in the image. We call this the "observation range".
            When performing your search, you can also select a minimum and a
            maximum value. We call this the "search range".


            There are three ways you can compare these two ranges:


            1) ANY - The observation range overlaps at least some with the
            search range. In other words, either the observation maximum is
            greater than the search minimum, or the observation minimum is
            less than the search maximum. This option is used to request
            the widest possible set of observations that contains at least
            some of the range you are searching for.

            2) ALL - The observation range is a strict superset of the search
            range. In other words, the observation minimum is less than the
            search minimum, and the observation maximum is greater than the
            search maximum. This option is used to ensure that an entire
            feature you are looking for (such as a crater) is visible in the
            observation.

            3) ONLY - The observation range is a strict subset of the
            search range. In other words, there is no pixel in the observation
            that contains a value that is smaller than the search minimum
            or larger than the search maximum. This option is used to tighly
            constrain your search to the smallest possible set of results.

        Q: How do I find all observations containing a particular body?
        A: Use surface geometry

Using Browse:
    -
        Q: Why are some image thumbnails colored?
        A:
            Thumbnails of imaging instruments (<em>e.g.</em> Cassini ISS,
            Galileo SSI, Voyager ISS, New Horizons LORRI, and most Hubble
            instruments) have a variety of filters that can be used. We color
            the thumbnails on the <b>Browse Results</b> page in an attempt
            to convey the approximate color of the filter that was used.
            If a thumbnail is not colored, it usually means a clear filter
            was used.
