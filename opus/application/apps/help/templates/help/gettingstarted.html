<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>OPUS (Outer Planets Unified Search) makes available more than 1,500,000
    images and spectra of the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune,
    and the Kuiper Belt) from Voyagers 1 and 2, Galileo, Cassini, New Horizons,
    and the Hubble Space Telescope. (More details about these missions and what
    OPUS provides can be found in the <b>About</b> section of the <b>Help</b>
    menu.)</p>

<p>OPUS makes it easy to perform four main tasks:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Search</b> for observations (e.g. images and spectra) using a variety
        of simple and complex search terms.</li>
    <li><b>Browse</b> the results of the search using intuitive, colored
        thumbnails.</li>
    <li><b>Get Details</b> on individual observations.</li>
    <li><b>Download</b> PDS products (e.g. raw or calibrated data, preview
        images, geometry metadata) for off-line use.</li>
</ol>

<p>These four tasks correspond to the four navigation tabs at the top of the
OPUS screen. You can switch among these tabs in any order as you explore the
data OPUS has to offer.</p>

<h3>Searching</h3>

<p>The <b>Search</b> tab consists of:</p>
<ol>
    <li>A series of <em>search terms</em> on the left side organized by
        category. By default, there are five categories:
        <ol>
            <li><b>General Constraints</b> includes high-level information such
                as the mission, instrument, and target name.</li>
            <li><b>PDS Constraints</b> includes search fields more internal to
                the PDS, such as the volume ID and Data Set ID. These fields
                are less likely to be useful to the casual user.</li>
            <li><b>Image Constraints</b> permits searching across missions and
                instruments by abstracting away details about the physical
                details of the observation, such as image size and exposure
                time.</li>
            <li><b>Wavelength Constraints</b> permits searching across missions
                and instruments by abstracting away details about what portion
                of the electromagnetic spectrum the observation represents,
                such as wavelength range and polarization.</li>
            <li><b>Surface Geometry Constraints</b> allows searching on the
                details of any body in the field of view, such as latitude and
                longitude or lighting geometry.</li>
            <li><b>Ring Geometry Constraints</b> allows search on the details
                of any planetary rings in the field of view, such as radius
                and longitude or lighting geometry.</li>
        </ol>

        In addition, new categories will appear when the search is sufficiently
        restricted. For example, when all observations in the current search
        are from Cassini, a <b>Cassini Constraints</b> category will appear
        with Cassini-specific search fields.</li>
    <li>A search of <em>search fields</em> on the right side. When OPUS starts.
        <b>Planet</b> and <b>Intended Target Name</b> are provided. Additional
        fields can be created by clicking on one of the search terms on the
        left.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are four basic types of search fields:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Multiple-Choice Fields</b> (such as <b>Planet</b> and <b>Mission</b>
        allow you to select one or more items by clicking on a checkbox. If you
        select more than one item, your search will return results applicable
        to any of those items.</li>
    <li><b>String Fields</b> (such as <b>Volume ID</b>) allow you to search on
        strings. You can provide partial strings that match the beginning or end
        of the data, are contained anywhere within, or match exactly, among
        other choices. As you type the your search string you will be presented
        with suggestions; click on one of the suggestions to have it placed
        in the search field.</li>
    <li><b>Numeric Fields</b> (such as <b>Observation Duration</b> or
        <b>Observed Ring Radius</b>) allow you to search on a range of numbers
        by specifying either a minimum or a maximum value, or both. An
        explanation of the Any/All/Only dropdown menu is provided in the FAQ.
        </li>
    <li><b>Date/Time Fields</b> (such as <b>Observation Time</b>) allow you
        to search on a range of dates and times by specifying a minimum or
        maximum date/time, or both. You can enter dates and times in a wide
        variety of formats, although the standard is YYYY-MM-DD[Thh:mm:ss.sss].
        </li>
</ol>

<p>For the latter two types of fields, as you type your search value you will
    receive feedback indicating if the value is legal. A green box means it
    is fine as-is. A yellow box means the value is illegal and you should change
    something before leaving the search field (by clicking elsewhere or hitting
    the Enter key). If you leave the field with an invalid value, it will turn
    red and no search will be performed until you fix the value.</p>

<p>As you enter search values, the number of results that are selected will
    constantly update in the <b>Browse Results</b> tab. In addition,
    you will be provided with the minimum/maximum values or date/times,
    or the number of results for each multiple-choice item, based on your
    current search criteria.</p>

<p>Once you have selected entered some search constraints, it's time to browse
    the results.</p>
