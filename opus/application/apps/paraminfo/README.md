# Param Info

The paraminfo apps stores static information about every searchable parameter,
such as data type, label, default widget, query type, etc.

The paraminfo app keeps track off all the information about the parameters
found in the tables, such as display name, display order, information on how to
query and what query options are available, etc. The app provides the model
reference to the param_info table.
