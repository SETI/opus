# Downloads 

This app handles all shopping cart download functionality.

These methods handle the preparing of zip files and download links at the point where a user moves to download their cart. It collects files found in the cart, creates manifest files, and creates zipped files for users to download. See the user_collections app for methods related to editing cart contents.
