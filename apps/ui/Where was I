this bug was causing a part of web UI to be broken too, so double thanks for reporting it! 

Some scientist on deadline in an alternate timeline where we didn't fix this bug thanks you as well.. 

Would love to hear any suggestions/feedback you have about OPUS or its API and documentation. 

cheers!

this bug was causing a part of web UI to be broken too, it wouldn't load the 'all metadata' section of the detail tabs (which is already painfully slow when it does work!) 

this came about after adding some errant metadata to the 'all_params' table during the Jupiter import. Now we have a test to catch this!

It's great to have hobbyists and others use our tools, they find bugs and report them before scientists on deadlines crash into them!
