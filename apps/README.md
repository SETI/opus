## How the Apps are Organized:

### search

this is the api (rename me!) it manages the different types of queries and performs all the queries.

### metadata

handles the metadata for the feedabck the user sees in the interface, things that change wrt the query being performed: range endpoints, nulls, total result counts..

### paraminfo

static information about every searchable parameter (data type, label default widget, how to query etc..)

### results

handles returning result sets

### ui

views that drive the OPUS user interface

### guide

a guide for using the API for querying opus from script or command line
